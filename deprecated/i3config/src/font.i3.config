# The font above is very space-efficient, that is, it looks good, sharp and
# clear in small sizes. However, if you need a lot of unicode glyphs or
# right-to-left text rendering, you should instead use pango for rendering and
# chose a FreeType font, such as:
# font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 10

# Font for window titles. Will also be used by the bar unless a different font
